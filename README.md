Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
Software Engineering is the art of designig, developing and maintaining software to solve  real world problems.
**importance of software Engineering:** 
_Security:_  implements protective measures to safeguuard user data
_reliability:_  enssures the software operates without bias
_scalability:_  ensures the sodtware can accoommodate increased demand without compromising functionality

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
i. idea generation: this is the initial stage during the thought of the software conception
ii. requirement analysis: gathering what is needed for the sotware to be developed with ease
iii. product design: building the software framwork
iv. product development:  making the software design into working code.
v. testing: finding errors within the system
vi. deployment: making the software availabl for use by external users
vii. maintenance: regular updates and maintenance schedule to ensure optimal perfomance

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
**waterfall methodology** 
Each phase has to be completed before moving on. 
rigid- there is Low flexibility, changes are hard to implement once a phase has been completed.
Hard to detect errors since testing is done once the software is fully dveloped.


**agile methodology**
It is iterative and incremental, with multiple cycles. 
Highly flexibile as it adapts to changing requirements. 
Regular customer feedback through collaboration with developer. 
Testing is continuous and done after each iteration.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
maintaining and updating software.
reports to the project manager about the progress of the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer 
ensures that the software meets the requirement before deployment.
collaborates with stakeholders to understand and clarify software requirement.
create development standards and procedures that programmers should follow.
 
Project Manager  
Manages and leads the development team
tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
manages resources required for the system development


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software that enables the creation of other software applications by providing a platform to write, compile, and debug code. e.g: Visual Studio Code, Android Studio, PyCharm.
1. An IDE can suggest code completions when a developer starts typing, streamlining the coding process.
2. IDE boost programmer productivity by handling repeatable development tasks that accompany every code change.

Version Control Systems (VCS) - these are software  that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. e.g GitLab, Git, Bitbucket
 Records changes allowing easy analysis of each of the modification. 
 Error Recovery: Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Insufficient time - software engineering often requirie engineers to work under high pressure to meet tight deadlines. 
this can be solved by adopting agile methodologies, to ease workflows by dividing large projects into manageable modules.
Limited Infrastructure 
 solution: Software engineers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing:
this is testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
it ensure each unit works correctly on its own.
it catches bugs early, simplifies debugging, and supports code refactoring without breaking functionality.
Integration Testing:
it is testing the interaction between integrated units or modules.
it detect issues in the way components communicate with each other.
It identifies interface defects, ensuring different modules work seamlessly together 
System Testing:
It is Testing the complete, integrated system against the specified requirements.
It validate that the entire system functions as intended.
Verifies end-to-end functionality, checking for performance, security, and compatibility issues.
Acceptance Testing:
Testing the users readiness for the software.
Ensures the software satisfies user needs and business goals.
Confirms the software works in real-world scenarios and gains client or stakeholder approval for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Enhanced user experience : Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results within the first prompt
Developer control : Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users interactions with the AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt:
Can you tell me about student performance?

Improved prompt:
Can you provide a summary of student performance for the last academic year, broken down by region and subject, highlighting any trends in math and science?

Clarity: Specifies that the focus is on the last academic year, not just any period.
Specificity: Requests a breakdown by region and subject, narrowing the scope.
Conciseness: Mentions math and science, guiding the response to key areas of interest.
